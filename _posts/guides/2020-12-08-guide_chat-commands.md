This guide covers all of the supported chat commands and potential inputs they have. These commands can be entered in chat at any time regardless of being in a lobby or not.

{:.notice--info}
All commands are activated by using "/" or "!" or "." and then the trigger keywords listed below. Example: "/spec" or ".spec" or "!spec" all trigger the "Spectate Player" command.

{:.notice--danger}
Do not make "say binds"!! Instead, prefer to create binds to the linked commands. There will never be any exclusive chat commands; they all directly tie to console commands/variables!


| Command                    | Triggers     | Functional Equivalent  | Examples     |
| :------------------------- | :----------: | :--------------------: | :---------- |
|  Bonus Teleport | **`"b", "bonus"`**   | **[`mom_restart <bonus>`](/command/mom_restart)** <br>(or `"/r <bonus>"`)   | `/b 2` teleports the player to Bonus Track 2.<br>`/b` does not work and will let you know that it requires a specific track number. Consider doing **`/r`** if you wish to restart the track.|
| Track Teleport   | **`"r", "restart"`** | **[`mom_restart`](/command/mom_restart)** |`/r 3` will restart the player to bonus track 3.<br>`/r` with no parameter will restart the player to the start of the current track.|
| Stage Teleport | **`"s", "stage"`** | **[`mom_restart_stage`](/command/mom_restart_stage)** | `/s 3` will teleport the player to the third stage of the current track.<br>`/s` with no parameter will teleport the player back to the current stage's trigger. |
| Set Start Mark | **`"setstart"`** | **[`mom_start_mark_create`](/command/mom_start_mark_create)** | `/setstart` while standing in the track start zone will create a start mark, allowing `/r` to teleport you back to the specific spot you are in. |
| Show Player Clips | **`"clips", "showclips"`** | **`r_drawclipbrushes (0, 1, 2)`**<br>(it cycles through these unless you specify the number)| `/clips 2` will set `r_drawclipbrushes` to `2`, which is the solid clipbrush render mode.<br>`/clips` will cycle through the render modes of drawing clipbrushes. If they're off, they go to 1 (wireframe), if on 1, to 2 (solid), if on 2, to 0 (off) and loops. |
| Show Triggers | **`"triggers", "showtriggers"`** | **`showtriggers_toggle`** | `/triggers` will toggle showing triggers in game. On if they're off, off if they're on. |
| Spectate Player | **`"spec", "spectate"`** | **[`mom_spectate`](/command/mom_spectate)** |`/spec goc` while Gocnak is in your lobby will begin spectating Gocnak, even if you are spectating, otherwise, will find the next best target to spectate.<br>`/spec` with no target will place you in spectator mode.|
| Stop Spectating | **`"stopspec", "specstop", "spawn", "respawn"`** | **[`mom_spectate_stop`](/command/mom_spectate_stop)** | `/spawn` while watching a player in your lobby, or while in free roam, will respawn you, exiting spectate mode.<br>`/spawn` while alive will not do anything, consider using **`/r -1`** if you wish to return to the map's initial spawn point. |
| Go To Player | **`"goto"`**| **[`mom_lobby_teleport <person>`](/command/mom_lobby_teleport/)** | `/goto goc` with Gocnak in your lobby will teleport you to where Gocnak is in the map.<br>`/goto goc` without Gocnak in your lobby will not teleport you, and instead give an error in chat. |
