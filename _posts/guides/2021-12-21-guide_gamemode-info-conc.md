## What is Conc?

Concussion Grenades (Concs) are a weapon from Team Fortress which do not cause damage, but instead moves players away from the explosion. Conc mode features maps which can be completed though using these concs. Momentum Mod's implementation of Concs comes from a mix of [Fortress Forever's implementation](https://github.com/fortressforever/fortressforever) combined with reverse engineering specific values from Team Fortress Classic.

## History of Conc

Concussion grenades were first featured in QuakeWorld Team Fortress, released in 1996. They were originally envisioned as an offensive tool for scouts and medics, used to clear defenders out of the way.  Players quickly realized they can be used to increase their own movement speed, unleashing lightning fast attacks. 
The Team Fortress developers were hired by Valve to create a new mod for Half-Life, and they recreated their QuakeWorld Team Fortress in the goldsrc engine, creating 'Team Fortress Classic'. As players learned to yield these powerful concussion grenades, custom maps were created specifically to test their concing ability. These runs were typically not timed; merely completing the map was the goal. In the early 2000s a subculture of TFC players formed, exclusively playing these conc maps, pushing the limits of what was possible, as new and more difficult jumps and maps were invented. Now the best of these maps will be ported to play in Momentum Mod. 

## How Conc Works


Concussion grenades will explode three seconds after they are primed. You can release and throw them at any time during the prime, or hold on to them through the explosion for a "hand-held" (HH) jump.  Concs will ***accelerate*** your movement speed: if you are already moving quickly, your speed will increase. Circle jumps can be used to gain initial speed, and maintaining momentum through the concs can be an essential skill to completing the map. 
Counter-intuitively, concs are more effective the farther the player is from them, until the maximum radius of the grenade, outside of which there is no effect. Finding this optimal distance is an important skill to get the maximum boost from each conc. 
Only one conc can be held in hand at any time, but concs can be tossed while the next one is primed. This allows long chains of multiple concs to be used to achieve unbelievable speed, distance, and acrobatics. 
Detailed instructions on various conc jumps can be found in this document: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CiUvsjXYiiFcklAT1QjUkTE33FsoQoqGspafVV9yMxE)

TODO port that here!!
