## What is Surf?

Surf is a very popular gamemode where people surf on ramps to get to the goal.

## History of Surf

3kliksphilip has created an excellent video going over the history of Surf with Mariowned, the creator of the gamemode:

## How Surf Works

Surf works by sliding across a ramp by holding the strafe key that is facing towards it. If there is a ramp curved inward that you want surf on and you have a good amount of speed, press the opposite facing strafe key to negate any horizontal velocity gained. If you are high up in the air and you want to gain speed, you can airstrafe to increase your velocity.
