Toggles practice mode, allowing the player to fly around in noclip during a run. Teleports the player back upon untoggling.

### Note:

If the timer is running and [`{{ page.cvar_ref }}`]({{ page.cvar_ref }}) is 1, this command will only activate practice mode if the player is not pressing any movement inputs.
