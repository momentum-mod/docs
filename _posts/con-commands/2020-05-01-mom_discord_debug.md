Helps debug Discord integration. Prints out the party ID (steam lobby ID), spectate secret, and join secret.

### Join secret

This includes the steam lobby ID and player's steam ID in the format `SteamLobbyID;SteamID`.

### Spectate secret

The same as the join secret but is only updated when in a map.
