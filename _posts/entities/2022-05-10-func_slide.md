----
A brush entity that allows the player to slide across the surface of it without friction. 

## Keyvalues

>**Keep player on slide surface** (StayOnSlide&lt;**boolean**&gt;)

 Forces the player to stay on the brush, even if it suddenly curves downwards or launches the player upwards.

>**Allow jumping** (AllowJump&lt;**boolean**&gt;)

 Allow the player to jump while sliding. The player is still required to be on a surface that isn't too steep to stand on.

>**Disable gravity** (DisableGravity&lt;**boolean**&gt;)

 Removes the effects of gravity on the brush, allowing for people to slide up impossible slopes.
