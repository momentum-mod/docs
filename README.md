> A documentation website for Momentum Mod, running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.

All documentation is kept up with the game's development branch not our current release version on Steam.

## What This Is

This repo is an open source collection of documentation for various aspects of the game Momentum Mod. This includes (but is not exactly limited to):

 * Documenting Momentum's console commands
 * Documenting Momentum's console variables
 * Documenting Momentum's custom entities
 * Guides for using Momentum Mod or related tools (zone tools, custom entities, etc)
 * Guides for mapping (**related to Momentum and/or its gametypes**)

## What This Isn't

This repo and website should pertain to being **only** about the game Momentum Mod and its related gametypes (Surf, Bhop, RJ, KZ, etc).

This means we do **NOT** want:
 * General guides about Hammer (this isn't [TopHattWaffle](https://www.youtube.com/user/rocketrascal34) / [Valve Dev Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Category:Level_Design))
 * Off-topic articles (this isn't [Medium](https://medium.com/))
 * Map-specific articles (this isn't [a wikia](https://www.fandom.com/))

This may change in the future, but for now, keep it about Momentum.
