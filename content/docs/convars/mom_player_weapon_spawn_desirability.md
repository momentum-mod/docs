{:.notice--info}
This convar has no effect on weapon-focused gamemodes such as Rocket Jump, Sticky Jump, Conc, and Defrag, and cannot be changed while the timer is running.

Sets the weapons desirability for when the player spawns, changing the convars value will also update the current carried weapons accordingly.
0 = None, 1 = Mode-recommended weapons, 2 = All allowed weapons.
