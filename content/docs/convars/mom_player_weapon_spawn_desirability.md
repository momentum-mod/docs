# mom_player_weapon_spawn_desirability

{{< hint info >}}
This convar has no effect on weapon-focused gamemodes such as Rocket Jump, Sticky Jump, Conc, and Defrag, and cannot be changed while the timer is running.
{{< /hint >}}

Sets the weapons desirability for when the player spawns, changing the convars value will also update the current carried weapons accordingly.
0 = None, 1 = Mode-recommended weapons, 2 = All allowed weapons.
