# Introduction

This guide gives an overview of all the steps required to officially port a map to Momentum Mod.

Porting is open to everyone, but the number one rule for porters is to **not** significantly change an existing map. We appreciate porting work but the map ultimately belongs to the author, and porters should not make significant visual or gameplay changes on maps without the author's permission (including Easter eggs, sorry!).

Please try not to rush through ports, and take time to read these docs. We're happy to help with any porting questions in the _#map-porting_ channel of [our Discord](https://discord.gg/momentummod), ask there if you have any questions.

## Reserving Maps / Getting Permission for Ports

Our stance on whether to port an existing maps is **opt-out**, i.e. we assume it's okay to port a map unless a mapper explicitly tells us they don't want it ported. Momentum gamemodes are simply too old with too many inactive mappers for us to get permission in every case, so we've put a great deal of effort into making porting as streamlined as possible. In the majority of cases, porting to Momentum involves far fewer changes than other games (CS:S → CS:GO, CS:S → TF2 etc...). That being said,

- Mappers can reserve porting their own map or opt out of having their map ported via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeheNDY5A960u6GtXCHtt3s_2vZJL3o5tMJ_ZNbYOpb6cx5nQ/viewform).
  - Submissions to that form can be found on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KHeWfhGUNpN267CXtPvVdf2h7eQbjPUhWVkE5NimYhg/edit?gid=2051215588#gid=2051215588). **Always** check that sheet first before starting a port. If you submit the map and it's been reserved / opted-out of porting, we'll reject the submission.
  - If someone has requested it to not be ported, do _not_ spam them with requests to port it.
- Try to verify whether a map has been released on a public forum (e.g. GameBanana, jump.tf forums) before porting.
  - Don't port a map if it seems like it's been released for a single server, unless you can get explicit permission.
- If in doubt, try your best to contact the original mapper.

For mappers porting their own map, restrictions on visual/gameplay changes generally don't apply and you're welcome to recompile for Momentum — it's your map.

# Source Map Basics

Momentum map porting is primarily about manipulating **BSP** files, the format for _compiled_ Source engine maps. In rare cases it may be required to decompile a map to a **VMF** file to edit in Hammer (Source's map editor), but since recompiling causes lighting recalculations and other small changes, we prefer modifying existing BSPs whenever possible.

As a format BSPs are notoriously complex (see the [VDC page](<https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/BSP_(Source)>)), consisting of numerous _lumps_ with different data structures. Fortunately for us, we generally only care about a few:

## The Entity Lump

[Entities](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Entity) are responsible for the interactive parts of a map, such as teleporters, spawn points, and triggers.

They can be either **point** entities, which have a single position in the map, or **brush** entities, which are defined by a brush shape in the map.

Entities are composed of _key-value pairs_, where the key is the name of the property and the value is its value.

Entities can have complex logical relationships using _Entity IO_, so avoid manually editing entities unless necessary, and save and reload regularly to test. Often, as with [removing jail timers](/guide/map_submission/map_porting/#jail-timers), you can simply remove a logic_timer without needing to change anything else.

## The Pakfile Lump

The [Pakfile](<https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/BSP_(Source)#Pakfile>) lump contains all the map's assets, such as textures, sounds, and models. It's essentially a ZIP file stored inside the map. When the map is loaded, the game mounts those assets in addition to the currently loaded assets from Momentum and other mounted games (e.g. CS:SS, TF2, etc.).

The pakfile also stores cubemaps, which are used for environment reflections and lighting in the map. These can be generated by the `buildcubemaps` command in-game.

# The Toolkit

## Lumper

The primary tool for porting maps is [Lumper](https://github.com/momentum-mod/lumper), a tool made specifically for modifying BSP files. It functions as a successor to tools like [VIDE](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VIDE) and [Entspy](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Entspy), but supports Strata Source BSPs and contains features specifically aimed at map porting and reviewing. It includes:

- **Entity Editor** - Create and modify entities in the map
- **Pakfile Explorer** - View and edit the pakfile as a file tree. It can be used to remove or pack assets, as well as automatically refactor references to assets in other lumps.
- **Texture Browser** - View all textures in a map, similar to Hammer's texture browser. This is used for content review.
- **Jobs** - Automated tasks that can be run on the BSP, such as:
  - Remove official Valve assets
  - Apply [Stripper](https://www.bailopan.net/stripper/) configs
  - Batch replace textures
- **Entity Review** - Lists invalid or problematic entities in the map
- **Compressed BSP Saving** - Saves the BSP in a compressed format, which is required for map submissions
- **Map Summary** - Reviews content in the BSP according to map submission requirements

![Lumper Example](/images/map_porting/lumper_example.png)

To use Lumper, download the latest release from the [Lumper releases page](https://github.com/momentum-mod/lumper/releases). Lumper is a standalone application, so you can run it without installing anything. Just extract the ZIP file and run it from anywhere.

{{< hint info >}} For Windows users, you can run `RegisterLumperURLProtocol.ps1` with PowerShell to register the `lumper://` URL protocol. This allows you to open BSP files directly from dashboard map pages, which is useful for reviewing. {{< /hint >}}

You can use Lumper to open any BSP file, modify it accordingly, and then save it.

Please note that Lumper does _not_ currently have undo/redo functionality, so be careful when making changes. Save regularly — Lumper will create backup files in the same directory by default.

### Game Sync

When editing entities, it can be difficult to find specific ones in the Entity Editor. You can use `getpos` and `setpos` in-game alongside Entity Editor filters and `origin` properties to find entities, but we also have a system called **Game Sync** which drastically improves this workflow.

To enable game sync, launch the game on the current map loaded in Lumper, set `sv_cheats 1` and `mom_lumper_sync_enable 1`. Then, press the "Connect to Game Sync" button in the top-right corner of Lumper. You should be able to:

- Sync your current in-game position with the "Spherical Radius" filter
- Sync the entity you're currently looking at with the key-value filters
- Teleport to entities by pressing the arrow icon on the Entity Editor list
- Automatically import Stripper configs from the in-game Entity Tools into Lumper

### Map Summary

Lumper's "Map Summary" info box (_Tools > Map Summary_) is a quick way to summarize the current state of the map. Map reviewers will always use this tool to check the map before approving it, so it's a good idea to check it yourself as you go.

![Lumper Map Summaries](/images/map_porting/lumper_map_summary.png)

## In-Game Entity Tools

Some entities must be modified or replaced to improve gameplay and promote competitive integrity according to Momentum Mod's standards.

Entities can be modified in-game with the `devui_show entitytools` command. This command will open an interface with various tools for quickly modifying and fixing map entities, and can modify those entities in-game in real-time, allowing you to test the changes without reloading the map.

![Entity Tools Example](/images/map_porting/entitytools_example.png)

{{< hint info >}} The Entity Tools use ImGui which can have very small fonts on large monitors. You can use `devui_font_scale` to change the font size. {{< /hint >}}

### Exporting to Lumper

The Entity Tools change in-game entities in real-time. To permanently apply these changes to a BSP, it generates a [Stripper](https://www.bailopan.net/stripper/) config file that can be used in [Lumper](#lumper).

You can export changes made with the Entity Tools by clicking the "Export To File" button. The entity changes are then written to a \<mapname\>.cfg file in your `maps/entitytools_stripper` folder. To use these files in Lumper, go to the **Jobs** page, create a _Stripper (File)_ job, and then load it from disk.

Alternatively if you have Game Sync enabled, you can click the "Export to Lumper" button in the Entity Tools, which will immediately create a _Stripper (Text)_ job.

Once a job is created, you can run it by clicking the "Run" button. This will apply the changes to the BSP file in Lumper. These changes will be displayed in the logs panel and modified entities will be marked as changed (indicated by \*) in the Entity Editor.

![Example Entity Tools Export](/images/map_porting/lumper_entitytools_export.png)

## Hammer

Entities can also be modified in Hammer without having to recompile the entire BSP. This is done by decompiling the map, making the entity changes, and then compiling with the "Only entities" option checked. The BSP file has to be in the same directory as the vmf for this to work.

![Only Entities](/images/map_porting/only_entities.png)

# Required Modifications

## Entity Review

Lumper's entity review tool will point out entities that are not supported by Momentum, or should be replaced with a different entity.

If an entity is marked as **Invalid** or **Warning**, it will generally have comments explaining the issue and what to replace it with. Invalid entities **must** be replaced or removed, while warnings are suggestions that are worth reviewing.

Pressing the "Edit" button on the right side of an entity in the Entity Review page takes you to the Entity Editor, and filters the list by that entity's classname. If you're not sure of the entity's purpose, teleporting in-game using [Game Sync](#game-sync) is helpful. You can also press the **VDC Reference** button on a page for that entity to see its docs on the Valve wiki. And if in doubt, please ask for help in the _#map-porting_ channel on Discord!

## In-game Entity Modifications

### Boost Ramps

`trigger_push` entities that push the player into a ramp are very inconsistent and give different speeds depending on how you jump into it. Replace these with `trigger_setspeed` for a more consistent and less exploitable boost.

Running directly into a trigger_push and getting boosted by it will automatically record your resulting horizontal and vertical speed in the Entity Tools window. Clicking "Convert to Set Speed" will then perform the conversion, applying the best settings to replicate this boost consistently. The resulting `trigger_setspeed` may have a horizontal speed that differs from the original trigger, but in combination with the automatically detected vertical speed, the original boost is replicated accurately.

![Ramp Boost](/images/map_porting/setspeed.png)

### Rapidly Reactivating Boost Triggers

The player can sometimes activate a boost multiple times in quick succession with problematic techniques, including "crouchboosting". Different styles of boost triggers require different adjustments to fix this issue:

1. **Jump-based Boosts** - Boosts that are designed such that the player should be boosted when they jump on them should be converted into a `trigger_multiple` that boosts the player with an `OnJump` output, such as `OnJump !activator,AddOutput,basevelocity # # #`.

![Floor Boost](/images/map_porting/floor_boost.png)

2. **Constant Push Floor Boosts** - If the boost is `trigger_push` based and it is important that the player is continuously pushed while inside it (not just when they jump or exit the trigger), you can leave it as a `trigger_push`, but use a `filter_momentum_surface_collision` filter with the "Touching standable surfaces" option so the boost only applies when the player is on the ground. You should only use this option if the floor is completely flat, otherwise the boost will re-apply every time the player touches another surface. If you have the original VMF and can recompile the map, removing the trigger and replacing the surface below it with a `func_conveyor` is also an option.

3. **Surf Ramp Boosts and Other Airborne Boosts** - When there is no ground for the player to jump on, a boost can be fixed by adding a cooldown so the player has to wait before re-activating the trigger. The Entity Tools trigger cooldown option will configure the trigger to disable for one second when the player exits it.

![Surf Ramp Boost](/images/map_porting/surf_ramp_boost.png)

### Jump Boosts

Boosts that should boost the player when they jump should use the new `OnJump` output instead of `OnEndTouch`. In addition to avoiding crouchboost exploits as mentioned previously, this also prevents other exploits. This goes for both basevelocity-based and gravity-based boosters.

![OnJump Boost](/images/map_porting/onjump_boost.png)

Some upward boosts briefly reverse the player's gravity instead of using basevelocity. This method may have a gradual and potentially awkward acceleration period. In particularly bad cases, consider converting these to the snappier basevelocity style. Note that the map geometry is sometimes built around the gravity acceleration period in a way that basevelocity cannot replace, so be sure to test this change well before committing it.

### Drop Teleports

Some maps, most notably surf maps, teleport the player into a floating "cage" that is open on the bottom to reset the player's velocity after they fail or transition between stages.

![Drop Teleport](/images/map_porting/drop_tele.png)

Momentum Mod introduces the "Keep Negative Z Velocity Only" velocity mode option for `trigger_teleport` that removes any horizontal velocity or upward vertical velocity from entities when they are teleported. This is more robust than only relying on the cage, but more importantly, this activates some important behaviors in Momentum Mod:

- When teleporting directly into a stage zone, it keeps the zone from activating until the player lands on the ground. This results in more competitively correct splits.
- It prevents players from using air acceleration until they land on the ground, preventing an unfavorable technique to gain speed early.

{{< hint info >}} These behaviors only activate when there is standable ground below the teleport destination, but you should still use "Keep Negative Z Velocity Only" for caged teleport destinations that are not above standable ground. {{< /hint >}}

All teleports with caged teleport destinations should use this velocity mode. In the in-game Entity Tools, open the "Teleport Velocity Mode" dropdown, select the destination that you want to change to a drop teleport, and then select the "Keep Negative Z" radio button.

![Velocity Mode Tools](/images/map_porting/velocity_mode.png)

### Jail Timers

Some old surf maps use a `logic_timer` to teleport all players to a jail after a few minutes. These timer entities and the associated teleport triggers should be removed using Lumper:

![Lumper Timer](/images/map_porting/lumper_timer.png)

![Lumper Teleports](/images/map_porting/lumper_teleports.png)

## Textures

Maps will sometimes contain textures that we don't want to include:

- Pornography, racism, or other "edgy" content
  - If something seems questionable and you're not sure about it, ask in Discord.
- Obvious copyrighted assets from other media
  - See [map submission guidelines](/guide/map_submission/map_submission/#other-copyright-assets)
  - This can be hard to make a judgment call on. Just look out for anything _extremely_ glaring.
  - Again, ask in Discord if you're unsure.

Lumper's **Texture Browser** is a fast way to quickly review all textures in the map, and can be used to replace bad textures with placeholders.

![Lumper Texture Browser](/images/map_porting/lumper_texture_browser.png)

The easiest way to replace a texture is to modify any VMT files that refer to the VTF file in question.

- Find any instances of VMTs files that refer to that VTF file in the Pakfile Explorer
  - Currently we don't have automation for this, but it's usually relatively obvious
- Replace the `$basetexture` value (maybe also `$bumpmap` and others) with some other texture on the map that won't look out-of-place
- Remove the original VTF file via Texture Browser / Pakfile Explorer

{{< hint info >}} Source engine textures are stored in **VTF** files, which are the image files, and **VMT** files, which are the material definitions for those textures.

VMTs are text files that define how the texture is used in the game, such as its shader type, properties, and other settings. VMTs are _usually_ stored in the same directory as the VTF files, and have the same name as the VTF file, but with a `.vmt` extension.

Note that multiple VMT files can refer to the same VTF file, so you may need to check multiple VMTs if the texture is used in multiple places. {{< /hint >}}

## Packed Game Assets

The pakfile lump of many maps contain copyrighted Valve assets, which we [cannot include](/guide/map_submission/map_submission/#source-assets).

Lumper contains a hash-based manifest file of all these assets, so removing them is very straightforward. You just need to run the **Remove Game Assets** job.

![Remove Game Assets](/images/map_porting/lumper_remove_assets.png)

## Sounds

The game allows players to set a volume level for each of several sound channels. Sound files packed in each map should be organized into specific folders corresponding to these sound channels:

| Channel  | Folder         |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Ambient  | sound/ambient/ |
| Music    | sound/music/   |
| Movement | sound/player/  |
| Weapons  | sound/weapon/  |
| UI       | sound/ui/      |

Lumper makes this process easy by automatically detecting entities and soundscapes that use these sounds (in fact it works for all assets!) and updating their paths. Simply drag-and-drop the sounds you want to move into the appropriate folder, then press "Yes" on the dialog that appears.

_Note: Path refactoring is very technically complex and has had issues in the past, so it's worth testing in game_

## Limited Ammo Triggers

Maps ported from TF2 for RJ and SJ sometimes have sections which limit the player's ammo. If infinite ammo throughout the map would significantly change the gameplay experience, consider adding ammo triggers to the map. Information concerning the ammo system in Momentum Mod can be found at [Ammo System](/guide/mapping/ammo_system).

Certain triggers can be added to a bsp file without having to recompile the map with the help of generated stripper configs that can be executed in Lumper. Tools available to help create these stripper configs include [vmf_to_stripper](https://github.com/benjl/vmf_to_stripper/) and [zoneToTrigger](https://github.com/Natanxp2/zoneToTrigger).

## Stripper Configs

Community servers often use Stripper configs for tweaking maps at runtime. Lumper can permanently apply the config using the "Stripper Config (File)" job, but **_do not blindly apply configs you find online_**! These configs can be useful as a reference, but it's almost always better to apply changes manually by editing the entity lump; many of the changes are not applicable to Momentum.

# Common Issues Porting Older Maps

When porting maps from older Source engine versions, there are a few issues that might come up due to incompatibilities with Strata Source.

## HDR Skyboxes

Skyboxes will sometimes fail to load in maps compiled with HDR. This is because the "sky" shader defaults to HDR, but will fail to load if the textures are not HDR. This issue can be fixed by setting the shader to "Sky_SDR".

![HDR Skybox](/images/map_porting/hdr_skybox.png)

![VTF Edit Sky SDR](/images/map_porting/vtfedit_sky_sdr.png)

## Corrupt HDR Cubemaps

Some maps from CS:S have corrupted HDR cubemaps in Momentum. If you notice this, you can try find working cubemaps from the CS:GO version. In cases we've seen they've been flat black textures, so you can replace HDR version with these VTFs (TODO: add these). [See this Github issue for discussion](https://github.com/momentum-mod/game/issues/2315#issuecomment-3097105058).

![Corrupt Cubemaps](/images/map_porting/corrupt_cubemaps.png)

## Dark Refraction Textures

Refraction textures in most maps do not render correctly. The cause of this issue is unknown and the only way to fix it currently is to recompile.

![Dark Refraction Textures](/images/map_porting/refraction_dark.png)

![Fixed Refraction Textures](/images/map_porting/refaction_fixed.png)

## Invalid VMT Files

Strata Source has stricter VMT parsing rules and will not load VMTs with syntax errors. These invalid VMT files must be manually fixed in Lumper or VTFEdit in order for the textures to load in game.

![Invalid VMT](/images/map_porting/invalid_vmt.png)

![Invalid VMT Lumper](/images/map_porting/invalid_vmt_lumper.png)
