## Ranked-Points System

**The points you earn from your time on a map is the sum of the points awarded from each of these 3 systems described below: WR/top10 points + formula points + group points.**

{{< hint info >}}
The systems described here are complete; we are in agreement that this is what the Ranked-Points should look like. The values chosen for percentiles, WR points, etc. are still up for debate; however, these should be simple to change later, should we decide to change them, because of the design of the system. For now, we consider the values to be informed-guess placeholders.

> There are no 'base completion points'; the formula system somewhat accounts for this, but we've determined that it is not worth having a system of its own

<sub>Aside -- Motivation;</sub>

<sub>Times ranked beyond the top10 are awarded points according to 2 systems: the Group system, and a Formula system. The group system rewards discrete bundles of points for players ranking within certain 'percentile' blocks. The formula system awards points simply according to a formula with a single parameter -- the player's rank.
The group system should award more points than the formula system; it should be the primary goal of the player to improve to the next group. The formula system simply provides bonus ranked points for improving within a group, so the player does not feel like intermediate improvements are a waste of effort.</sub>

### WRs and Top10s system

WRs award a fixed number of points for all maps. For now, we set this to be 3,000 points.
Ranks 2-10 award some percentage of the WR points.

```
Rank 1 = 3000 points = 100% of WR
Rank 2 = 2250 points = 75% of WR
Rank 3 = 2040 points = 68% of WR
Rank 4 = 1830 points = 61% of WR
Rank 5 = 1710 points = 57% of WR
Rank 6 = 1590 points = 53% of WR
Rank 7 = 1515 points = 50.5% of WR
Rank 8 = 1440 points = 48% of WR
Rank 9 = 1365 points = 45.5% of WR
Rank 10 = 1290 points = 43% of WR
```

### Formula system

Points awarded is some equation of the form `A / (rank + B)`, where `A` is a scaling constant, and `B` is a smoothing constant.\
We choose `A` = 50000, `B` = 49.\
In this case the graph shows our equation `Points = 50000 / (rank + 49)`\

{{< /hint >}}

<sub>Ex:<br>
Player sets a time of rank 468 on a map with 1333 completions.<br>
Formula points awarded = `50000 / (468 + 49)` = 96.7 => 97 points. (Note that the # of completions on the map did not affect the points awarded!)</sub>

### (New) Group System

(based on @Joe's & Jux's comments about minimum group sizes)\
(plus lots of help from Jux and Aux)

4 groups, loosely 'percentile'-based (in fact, a function of #completions, but not as simple as a percentage). Instead of calculating group boundaries directly from percentiles, we calculate group _sizes_ based on a simple maximizing function --

Group size = `max(A(x), minSize)`

<sup>_max(A, B) simply returns the value of the larger parameter._<br>
_A is a function of #completions, minSize_</sup>

Group 1 always starts at rank 11, and its size is determined from its group size formula.

The formula to determine group size, `A(x)` (where `x` is the # of completions of the map), is\
`_A(x) = SF * (x^E)`, where `SF` and `E` are defined uniquely for each group:\
`SF` = Scale factor, `E` = Exponent

```
Group 1: E = 0.5, SF = 1
Group 2: E = 0.56, SF = 1.5
Group 3: E = 0.62, SF = 2
Group 4: E = 0.68, SF = 2.5
```

minSize is another parameter which varies per group:

```
Group 1: minSize = 10
Group 2: minSize = 45
Group 3: minSize = 125
Group 4: minSize = 250
```

<sup>Ex.<br>
On a map with 400 completions:

```
Group 1 size = max(1 * 400^0.5, 10) = max(20, 10) = 20
Group 2 size = max(1.5 * 400^0.56, 45) = max(42.98, 45) = 45
Group 3 size = max(2 * 400^0.62, 125) = max(82, 125) = 125
Group 4 size = max(2.5 * 400^0.68, 250) = max(147, 250) = 250
```

<sup>Therefore:</sup>

```
Group 1 = ranks 11-30 (begins from rank 11, contains 20 spots)
Group 2 = ranks 31-75 (begins from rank 31 = end of G1, contains 45 spots)
Group 3 = ranks 76-200 (begins from rank 76 = end of G2, contains 125 spots)
Group 4 = ranks 201-450 -- note this exceeds #completions (400)! So it extends all the way to rank 400, and anyone who completes the map is automatically in at least group 4.
```

**Group Points**:\
 <sup>(going by WR points = 3000) (no particular pattern; eyeballed). Keep in mind that you also get points from the formula!</sup>

```
Group 4 = 90 points = 3% of WR
Group 3 = 210 points = 7% of WR
Group 2 = 390 points = 13% of WR
Group 1 = 600 points = 20% of WR
```
