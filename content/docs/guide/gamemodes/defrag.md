## What is Defrag?

Defrag is considered the grandfather mode for all of Momentum Mod's supported modes. Defrag is based on the movement found in Quake, specifically Quake 3 Arena, and is broken into two modes, "VQ3" and "CPM".

## History of Defrag

The history of defrag can be traced back to the Quake series. Quake's modding community quickly loved the game's open architecture, leading to them creating various custom modifications (mods), game modes, and maps

Defrag short for (defragmentation) refers to the act of optimizing a player's movements through the precise control and navigation of an obstacle course (Maps). These were designed to challenge players to complete these maps as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Defrag game modes typically featured intricate layouts with ramps, jumps and other obstacles requiring the player to master the game's movement mechanics. Including strafing, rocket jumping, bunny hopping, and surfing, Players could compete for the fastest times on these maps and the community fostered a culture of speedrunning and precise movement.
 
The defrag community grew particularly strong in the Quake 3 era, where the game's refined movement mechanics provided a solid foundation for advanced movement techniques, Players not only used these in defrag but a lot of these movement techniques also got used in competitive tournaments. Also, the players didn't only aim to complete maps but they also wanted to discover and exploit faster and more optimal routes and movement mechanics.

Defrag was the grandfather of a lot of the movement techniques used in most other FPS games, The game mode itself might not have been the most popular but it impacted the gaming community in a whole in a positive manner
