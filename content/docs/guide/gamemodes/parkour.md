## What is Parkour?

Parkour is the movement from Titanfall 2, which sees players slide jumping, wallrunning and preserving speed.

Momentum Mod's implementation of Parkour comes from [the implementation found in Half-Life 2 Mobility Mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/mobility-mod-for-half-life-2), with adjustments from feedback from the Titanfall 2 speedrunning community.

## History of Parkour

Titanfall 2 was released, and boom, Parkour.
