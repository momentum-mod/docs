## What is Sticky Jump?

Based on the Demoman class from Team Fortress 2, players shoot explosives that stick to surfaces and have control over their detonation which propels themselves throughout maps. Up to 3 of these arching bombs can be used at once to go at extremely high speeds, or they can be in alternation to pogo on the floor, the wall, or even in the air.

Sticky Jump movement can be found in Team Fortress 2, however due to the high damage that stickybombs deal it has extremely limited use in competitive games. Instead, most sticky jumping is done on special 'jump' maps and servers that give the player infinite health and ammo.

The version of Sticky Jump implemented in Momentum Mod has a few key changes from Team Fortress 2. Most notably, all health and ammo is gone. Instead, players are limited to having 3 stickybombs out at any given time and further restrictions are done using special triggers in the maps.

## How Sticky Jump Works

Typically the player shoots a stickybomb at the ground, then jumps, crouchs, and detonates the sticky all in extremely quick succession. If done properly the player will go flying in a certain direction.

Stickybombs take a few seconds to arm before they're able to be detonated, marked by the three circles on the HUD and a brief flash when they're ready. Because of this, pogoing (or bouncing multiple times in a row without touching the ground) can be much more involved than in rocket jumping. The player must predict where they will land and shoot there ahead of time, so that the sticky is armed and ready by the time they're above it. Essentially the player must always place the next sticky before detonating the previous one. Also as stickies don't require surfaces to detonate, players can sometimes detonate a sticky in the air to allow extra height, though this takes even more precision.
