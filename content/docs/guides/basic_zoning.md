![Zone Guide](/assets/images/guide_headers/guide_basic_zones.jpg)

This Guide will cover the most basic usage of the Zoning Tools to create a Start and End Zone.  
> Looking for Stages and Bonuses?  
> Try the [Advanced Zoning Guide](/guide/advanced-zoning/).

## Prerequisites
To follow this Guide you should:
- Be on Momentum 0.8.0+
- Be running Momentum with `-mapping`
- Have the Developer Console enabled and be able to use it

## Opening the GUI
In order to get the GUI to appear, type `mom_zone_showmenu` in the Console, it should look like this:  

![Zone Menu](/assets/images/zone_guide/zone_menu.png)

{:.notice--info}
You will lose the ability to look around at some point and your mouse cursor will re-appear.  
To be able to look around again, right-click the GUI.  
Right-clicking will toggle between looking around and interacting with the GUI.


To get started, click the ***Enable Zone Editing*** checkbox, the other options will become available.  
You will also see a 3D "cursor" appear where you are looking:  

![3D Cursor](/assets/images/zone_guide/3d_cursor.png)

This shows where you will be creating the Zone in the map; it snaps to a grid, so it will not follow where you are looking exactly.

## Creating a Zone
In this example the Zone will fill this doorway:

![Creating the Zone 1](/assets/images/zone_guide/zone_create_0.jpg)

First, click the ***Create Zone*** button - you will be able to look around again.  

{:.notice--info}
If you want to start again at any point, click ***Cancel Zone***.


Then find one of the corners of the Zone you want to create, so for this example that could be at the rear-right of the doorway:

![Creating the Zone 2](/assets/images/zone_guide/zone_create_1.jpg)

Click and you'll start to drag out a rectangle on the floor.  
This example will move the cursor to the front-left corner to fill out the doorway:

![Creating the Zone 3](/assets/images/zone_guide/zone_create_2.jpg)

Once the other corner is where you want it, click again - the rectangle will become a cube.  
Starting moving the mouse upwards to set the height of the Zone:

![Creating the Zone 4](/assets/images/zone_guide/zone_create_3.jpg)

{:.notice--info}
The height of a Zone does not snap to the grid currently, so you will have to eyeball it!


If you are satisfied with the Zone click again and the outline will change colour:

![Creating the Zone 5](/assets/images/zone_guide/zone_create_4.jpg)

In this example the Zone has become green - it is a Start Zone.

To create the End Zone, go to where you want it and repeat the process, you should have a red cube this time:

![End Zone](/assets/images/zone_guide/zone_end.jpg)

## Saving the Zones
If all goes well you should be able to click ***Save Zones***, close the GUI and test the map.  

Zones are stored in a `.zon` file of the same name as the map.  
So for this example the map is called *"cubemaptest"* so the `zones/` folder will now have a `cubemaptest.zon` file.

> This should be enough for basic testing and Linear maps.  
> For more than one Stage or Bonuses check the [Advanced Zoning](/guide/advanced-zoning/) Guide.
