# Gamemode Guide: Conc

## What is Conc?

Conc, short for "**Conc**ussion Grenade Jumping", is a classic game mode from the classic Team Fortress, involving priming a concussion grenade to explode at just the right time to propel the player throughout the map.

Momentum Mod's implementation of Conc comes from a mix of [Fortress Forever's implementation](https://github.com/fortressforever/fortressforever) combined with reverse engineering specific values from Team Fortress Classic.

## History of Conc

Conc comes from Team Fortress Classic, which was based on the Quake mod "Quake Fortress" by the same developers. Team Fortress Classic is the precursor to the beloved Team Fortress 2, but runs on Valve's Goldsrc engine.

TODO full history of conc as a gamemode!!

## How Conc Works

Please play conc.

The further away from the grenade you are, the **_more_** it boosts you! Rather backwards, but it's a fun way to play!
